There is an htpasswd-multitenant file here and an oauth.yaml.  These are the raw YAMLs.  Sometimes it is better to do all this through the GUI but the information is here for reference.

In the GUI, go to Administration --> Cluster Settings --> Configuration --> Oauth --> Add Identity Provider

Once these users are created, you should login one time as user user to created the user-identity mappings
